---

I am a Mathematician with more then 4 years experience in analyzing problems. I am proficient in Python(Pandas,GraphLab,Scikit,Numpy,Sci-Py) and MYSQL. You may find all my git information here: [Github](https://github.com/krismanaya). Furthermore, I also obtained a minor in United States History, which helped me to obtain strong oral and written communication skills. My personal work style is to listen to others and learn from others so I may be able to add real credible input; I believe the importance of working with others is connecting with them as a friend and a colleague. 

During my free time I play music in a band called [Doombird](https://open.spotify.com/album/6w0S6iqE64L6DqAogrwSvf) and my favorite type of music is mostly experimental ambient, but for sanity I write and arrange more pop electronic music so don't be afraid to click that spotify link! 

I also love me some horror movies and anything that John Carpenter did! Check out my instagram feed if you wanna see my day-to-day life. ~ K
