## The Survivors and Viticms on the Titanic
The Titanic was set to port along the east coast of New York, however, on April 15,1912, more then 1,500 people lost their [lives](https://history.com/topics/titanic). Our objective was to investigate the survivors and vitcims who tragically lost their lives. 

We were given demographics and passenger information from **891** of the **2224** passangers and crew on board [Titanic Data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv). We wish to ask the question: *what factors made people more likely to survive?*

## What are the sample metrics? 
The Titanic data allows us to get a sample of the passangers who survived, class, name, sex, age, number of siblings; number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, passanger fare, cabin and where they embarked. Of the **891** passengers aboard we found that **38%** of passangers survived on the titanic at an average age of **24** years old. Mostly the survival was in the class 2 seating at an average fare of **$32**:

* **Survived** : **38%** 
* **Victims**  : **62%** 
* **Age**      : **24** 
* **Class**    : **2** 
* **Fare**     : **$32** 

## How many people survived and were victims by class? 
The most interesting insight (IMO) was there a better survival outcome based on socio-economic status? Given your position on the ship and sex what was the likely hood of your survival?
