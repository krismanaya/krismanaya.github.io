* **Two color schemes** — One for Solarized Dark and one for Solarized Light. Just swap the reference to the `colors-dark.css` file with `colors-light.css` if you don't like light-on-dark.
* **Linkblog support** — Solar will turn your post title into an external link if you add `external-url: http://example.org` to a post's YAML front matter.
* **Responsive Design** — Solarized adapts to fit any screen size.
